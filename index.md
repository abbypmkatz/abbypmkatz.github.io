# Hi! I'm Abby. Welcome to my site. 
I am a secondyear PhD student in the Behavioral and Social Health Sciences program at Brown University School of Public Health. This website is a static site produced for the summer workshop, *Digital Humanities Projects 2023* through the [Center for Digital Scholarship](https://library.brown.edu/create/cds/about/).
