# About Me
Abby Katz (pronouns: she/her/hers) has research interests at the intersection of food, history, culture, policy and health equity. She received a M.A. in Food Studies from New York University, and a B.A. in Food, Culture, and Sustainable Society (Individualized) and Human Rights from the University of Connecticut. Abby is particularly interested in using mixed-methods to better understand food environment influences on Black and Latinx/e youth. Prior to Brown, Abby worked in the Department of Population Health at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and the UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health on projects investigating neighborhood and environmental factors on food choice, access, and health. Abby also contributed to research projects to improve the administration of New York State Medicaid and both access and quality of addiction health services care. Outside of her work and the classroom, Abby has prioritized working with nonprofit organizations and engaging with grassroots community movements to enhance her education.
